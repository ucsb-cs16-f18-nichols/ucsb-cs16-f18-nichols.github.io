## Under the hood of program compilation and execution
* From high-level programs to machine code
    * What are .h, .o and .cpp file?
    * What is an execuatble 
    * Steps in compilation
    * Creating object files and linking programs with g++
* Separate compilation with Makefiles [read about Makefile](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/16wiki/index.php/C%2B%2B:_Separate_Compilation_and_Makefiles)
* Compile-time errors
* Linker errors
* Header guards


# Topics

## Memory

## C++ arrays
* Intro to lab04
* C/C++ arrays are like lists in Python and Arrays in Java. We will discuss the differences between these.
* Declaring and initializing arrays in C++
* Tracing code involving arrays
* Array pitfalls: out of bound array access
