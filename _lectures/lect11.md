## Code from lecture


#Topics

The good:

* Pointers allow arrays to be passed to functions efficiently
* Pointers allow arrays of large structs to be traversed effiently

The bad:

* Pointers can only point to one type of data (not generic)
* They don't automatically point - need to do some work

The ugly

* Bugs in code that involves pointers can cause your program to irrecoverably crash (Segmentation fault)
* Examples: dereferencing a null pointer, out of bound array access, dereferncing a pointer that has junk value.

## C++ Memory model
* Barebones model of memory: value vs address
* Scope: local vs. global
* Layout of compiled C++ program in memory: text, global data , heap and stack
